# Hello World!

I've meaning to create a blog for a while, I mean quite a while now! 
I've bought a personal domain from a domain registrar and not used it at least 2 times! I would buy the domain name then get on the task of creating my personal blog but the idea will slowly take the back burner due to everything else in my life. There is always something right ?


To be honest, I think the main reason is that I'm a bit of perfectionnist and I like to plan out the perfect structure and future-proof my work before I get down on it. I also tend to take longer when I'm spoiled with choice.


And oh, boy  there's a lot of choices to be made when deciding to build a website or starting a blod. The blog name, the domain name, the CMS to use, Dynamic or Static, the folder structure, the URL structure, where to host, and this is just the tip of the iceberg.


I've finally come to a point where I found that I found peace with not making things perfectly, as long as I create, it's better than nothing. The desire for perfection should not come into the way of productivity.


After plenty of long research sessions, I became interested in the Jamstack and Static Site Generator, they are a low friction, low maintenance and low cost or even free way to create and host a website and blogs.


I found a a great [video tutorial by Techno Tim](https://youtu.be/F8iOU1ci19Q) which shows users how to build a blog using the static site generator [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), and theme for Jekyll called [Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy.git) Make sure to show them some love if you like it.


I think, the Jamstack simplicity that the Jamstack architectural approach provides has made me confident enough to get started, and if there's a need to change things, to make things better, I would be able to hopefully, transfer painlessly my content to that something more perfect.


But until then, here we are. 


This blog will serve as technical blog of things that I find interesting and things that I'm learning on my journey to become a DevOps or Cloud Engineer, I may occasionally post some off topic article. We'll see.
